# fractional-order-dynamics

This repository contains MATLAB code that approximates fractional-order operators using many integer-order operators in parallel. 

The original purpose of the code was to simulate the behavior of neurons in the brain (specifically, in the brain stem) that control the movements of the eyes. These simulations are described in the following journal article:

Anastasio TJ. The fractional-order dynamics of brainstem vestibulo-oculomotor neurons. Biological cybernetics. 1994 Nov;72(1):69-79.

Included in that article is some mathematical development, for which I acknowledge the contributions of Ehtibar Dzhafarov.
